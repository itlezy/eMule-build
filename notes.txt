Deleting the .vs folder does not affect or solve the problem.

The issue is in Microsoft.CppCommon.targets:

 <!-- make sure lib's pdb is near the lib -->
 <Copy Condition="'%(ClCompile.ProgramDatabaseFileName)' != '$(OutDir)$(TargetName).pdb' and
                  ('%(ClCompile.DebugInformationFormat)' == 'ProgramDatabase' or '%(ClCompile.DebugInformationFormat)' == 'EditAndContinue') and
                  Exists(%(ClCompile.ProgramDatabaseFileName))" SourceFiles="%(ClCompile.ProgramDatabaseFileName)" DestinationFiles="$(OutDir)$(TargetName).pdb" />

The simplest way to fix the problem is to comment out this section, entirely:

 <!-- make sure lib's pdb is near the lib 
 <Copy Condition="'%(ClCompile.ProgramDatabaseFileName)' != '$(OutDir)$(TargetName).pdb' and
                  ('%(ClCompile.DebugInformationFormat)' == 'ProgramDatabase' or '%(ClCompile.DebugInformationFormat)' == 'EditAndContinue') and
                  Exists(%(ClCompile.ProgramDatabaseFileName))" SourceFiles="%(ClCompile.ProgramDatabaseFileName)" DestinationFiles="$(OutDir)$(TargetName).pdb" />  -->

You can interactively rewrite history with git rebase -i:

git rebase HEAD~6 -i 
Will open your editor and allow you to either squash multiple commits into one, or completely remove them from history (by deleting the line for those commits in your editor.) The ~6 means rewrite the last 6 commits, the -i means do it interactively. In your case, you'll want to remove the lines that say "pick 1c4a11a" and "pick b4ab3c".

Note that the most recent commit in the editor that gets launched is the last line, not the first one, and since you're rewriting history and you've already pushed, you'll also have to "git push --force", not just "git push" in order to send your changes upstream.
